**Objective:**  
Write a Python script to practice creating variables, assigning them values, performing arithmetic operations, and reassigning the results to variables.

**Instructions:**  
**Step 1: Variable Assignment**

1. Create a variable named `x` and assign it a value.
2. Create a variable named `y` and assign it a value.

**Step 2: Basic Arithmetic Operations**

3. Create a variable named `sum_result` and assign it the sum of `x` and `y`.
4. Create a variable named `diff_result` and assign it the difference when `y` is subtracted from `x`.
5. Create a variable named `product_result` and assign it the product of `x` and `y`.
6. Create a variable named `quotient_result` and assign it the quotient when `x` is divided by `y`.

**Step 3: Variable Reassignment**

7. Reassign a new value to `x` by adding `2` to its original value.
8. Reassign a new value to `y` by multiplying its original value by `3`.

**Step 4: Output**

9. Print the values of `sum_result`, `diff_result`, `product_result`, and `quotient_result`.
10. Print the updated values of `x` and `y` after reassignment.

**Example**

Assume the initial values are:
- `x = 10`
- `y = 5`

After performing the arithmetic operations:
- `sum_result = 15`
- `diff_result = 5`
- `product_result = 50`
- `quotient_result = 2.0`

After reassignment, if you update `x` to `12` and `y` to `15`, the output should be:
```
Sum: 15
Difference: 5
Product: 50
Quotient: 2.0
Updated x: 12
Updated y: 15
```
